There are 2 movement scripts attached to the car
First one is turned off but its more inline with the atari style controller and games.

The second one which IS enabled is more fun and better and cooler and if you accelerate and turn and TAP brake, you actual speed drift for a second. 

The map is just a test, red squares have collision like buildings, and green squares just represent grass.
